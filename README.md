# ParticleDemo
Basic Pygame Particle Demo

This is just a simple demo of Particles in Pygame.
I plan on implementing this into my game PyJump, and Using it on other projects as well.

Creating a basic particle system in pygame is much easier than I thought and was really fun to mess around with.

## Demo 
coming soon
